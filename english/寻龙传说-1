首先 龍尾部落
First... Tail[teɪl].

生活在炎熱的沙漠 有一幫狡猾的僱傭兵
A sweltering[ˈsweltərɪŋ] desert[ˈdezərt , dɪˈzɜːrt] with sneaky[ˈsniːki] mercenaries[ˈmɜ:səˌneri:z]

喜歡出陰招
who fight[faɪt] dirty[ˈdɜːrti].

第二 龍爪部落
Second, Talon[ˈtælən].

一個水上市場 以快速交易而聞名
A floating market famous[ˈfeɪməs] for fast deals

他們的戰士速度更快
and fighters with even faster hands.

第三 龍脊部落
Third, Spine[spaɪn].

生活在寒冷的竹林
A frigid[ˈfrɪdʒɪd] bamboo[ˌbæmˈbuː] forest[ˈfɔːrɪst]

守護他們的是異常魁梧的戰士
guarded[ˈɡɑːrdɪd] by exceptionally[ɪkˈsepʃənəli] large warriors[ˈwɔːriərz],

和他們的巨斧
and their giant[ˈdʒaɪənt] axes[ˈækˌsiz].

第四 龍牙部落 我們最強勁的敵人
Fourth, Fang[fæŋ]. Our fiercest[fɪrsist] enemy.

保護這個部落的 是憤怒的刺客
A nation protected by angry assassins[ə'sæsɪnz],

和他們更憤怒的貓
and their even angrier cats.

好了
Okay,

我們要準備十字弓和投石機
so we're gonna need some crossbows[krɔːs , baʊz] and catapults['kætəpʌlts] and...

火焰投石機怎麼樣
Ooh! What about flaming[ˈfleɪmɪŋ] catapults?

或者 用龍尾族的蝦醬
Or, how about shrimp[ʃrɪmp] paste[peɪst] from Tail.

龍爪族的香茅(柠檬香茅) 龍脊族的竹筍(竹笋)
lemongrass[ˈlɛmənˌɡræs] from Talon, bamboo shoots[ʃuːts] from Spine,

龍牙族的辣椒 再加上龍心族的棕櫚糖 怎麼樣
chilis[ˈtʃɪlis] from Fang and palm sugar from Heart?
chili辣椒；香辣粉 chilies[ˈtʃiliz]

是要給他們下毒嗎
We'll poison[ˈpɔɪzn] them?

不 我們不會給他們下毒
No, we're not going to poison them

也不會跟他們戰鬥
and we're not going to fight them.

是要跟他們一起吃飯
We're going to share a meal[miːl] with them.

-什麼 -是我請他們來的
- Wait, what? - I invited[ɪnˈvaɪtɪd] them.

但他們都是敵人啊
But they're our enemies.

他們與我們為敵
They're only our enemies

只是因為他們認為龍珠的魔法
because they think the Dragon Gem

給我們帶來了繁榮
magically[ˈmædʒɪkli] brings us prosperity[prɑːˈsperəti].

太荒謬了 這和龍珠沒關係
That's ridiculous[rɪˈdɪkjələs]. It doesn't do that.

但他們認為有關係
They assume[əˈsuːm] it does,

我們對他們也有類似的想像
just like we assume things about them.

拉雅 每個部落都以龍的一部分命名
Raya, there's a reason why each land

這是有原因的
is named after a part of the dragon.

我們曾經是和諧統一的整體
We were once unified. Harmoniously as one.

龍佑之邦
Kumandra.

爸 那都是古代的事了
That's ancient history, Ba.

但它也可以重現
But it doesn't have to be.

聽著 如果我們不停止爭鬥
Listen, if we don't stop

並且再次學會互相信任
and learn to trust one another again,

那麼遲早
it's only a matter of time

我們會互相毀滅
before we tear each other apart.

我不希望你生活在那樣的世界裏
This isn't the world I want you to live in.

我相信我們可以再次成為龍佑之邦
I believe that we can be Kumandra again.

但是必須有人邁出第一步
But someone has to take the first step.

相信我
Trust me.

爸 氣氛好像有點緊張啊
Things look a little tense, Ba.

別擔心 我會講個笑話當開場白
Don't worry, I'm gonna open with a joke.

千萬別
Please don't.

開玩笑的
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

龍尾族 龍爪族
People of Tail, Talon,

龍脊族和龍牙族
Spine, and Fang,

歡迎來到龍心部落
welcome to Heart.

我們互相為敵的時間已經太久了
For far too long, we have been enemies,

但今天是新的一天
but today is a new day.

今天 我們可以再次成為龍佑之邦
Today, we can be Kumandra once more.

說得真好 班加酋長
Nice speech, Chief Benja.

你讓我們來的真正目的是什麼
But why'd you really bring us here?

要搶劫嗎
Are you gonna rob us?

他們為什麼要搶我們
Why would he need to rob us?

龍心部落已經擁有一切了
The land of Heart already has everything.

你們部落有最強大的武器
Oh, it's easy to pontificate on Kumandra

所以才敢說什麼龍佑之邦
when you hold the mightiest weapon in all the lands.

龍珠不是武器 是神聖的遺物
The gem's not a weapon. It's a sacred relic.

龍佑之邦就是個笑話
Kumandra! Kumandra's a joke!

他大老遠把我們叫過來
He brought us all this way

就是為了講個童話
to talk about fairy tales.

根本毫無意義
This is pointless!

我有話要說
I have something to say.

誰餓了
Who's hungry?

去吧 沒事的
Go ahead. It's all right.

我是龍牙族的納瑪莉
I'm Namaari, of Fang.

嗨 納瑪莉 我是拉雅
Hi, Namaari. I'm Raya.

那是希蘇嗎
Is that Sisu?

不好意思
Sorry, um, yeah,

我可能有點像個龍呆子
I might be a little bit of a dragon nerd.

嘿 我才是戴著希蘇粉絲項鏈的人
Hey, I'm the one wearing the Sisu fan necklace.

來吧
Come on.

你吃飯了嗎
Have you eaten yet?

真的嗎
Seriously?

你媽媽真是這麼說的
Your mom actually said that?

好尷尬 好吧 下一個問題
Awkward. Okay, next question.

近身肉搏還是用劍
Hand-to-hand or swords?

-永遠選劍 -是吧
- Blades all day. - Right?

好 正裝還是休閒裝
Okay, dressy or casual?

只有怪物會選擇
Only a monster would choose

日常穿這種衣服
to wear this outfit on the regular.

米飯還是燉菜
Uh, rice or stew?

我沒想到這個問題會讓你為難
I didn't think that'd stump you.

其實我已經很久
Uh... This is actually one of the first times

沒有吃過米飯了
I've had rice in awhile.

真的嗎
Really?

在外人看來 龍牙族也許還不錯
Fang may look nice on the outside,

但我們內部有很多嚴重問題
but we have some pretty big holes on the inside.

哦
Oh.

對不起 我不該破壞氣氛的
Sorry. Didn't mean to bring it down.

說到哪了
So, where were we?

我們都是單親家庭
We both have single parents

講的笑話都特別尷尬
who are terrible at telling jokes.

都是女戰士
We're both warrior women

討厭不舒服的正裝
who despise uncomfortable formal wear.

而且我們都是希蘇的超級粉絲
And we're both Sisu superfans.

對
Yeah.

你知道嗎 根據龍牙傳說 她還活著
You know, Fang legend says she's still out there.

希蘇 你在開玩笑吧
Sisu? You're kidding, right?

想看看嗎
Wanna see something?

他們允許你帶著它
Are you supposed to have that?

不允許
No.

根據這上面說的
According to this,

強大的希蘇趕走莊魔之後
after the Mighty Sisu blasted away all the Druun,

她掉入水中 順水漂流而下
she fell into the water and floated downstream.

傳說她現在正沉睡在河流的盡頭
Legends say she's now sleeping at the river's end.

那條河 這裏有幾百條河
But which river? There's, like, hundreds.

我不知道
I don't know.

但如果我們能找到她 你能想像是什麼樣子嗎
But if we could find it, could you imagine?

一條龍回到了世界
A dragon back in the world.

情況可能會好得多
Things could be so much better.

是啊
Yeah.

也許我們真的能再次成為龍佑之邦
Maybe we really could be Kumandra again.

給你
Here.

哇
Whoa.

真的嗎
Really?

一個龍呆子送給另一個龍呆子的禮物
From one dragon nerd to another.

嘿
Hey.

跟我來 姐妹 給你看樣東西
Come with me, dep la. I wanna show you something.

希蘇之魂 我能感覺到
The spirit of Sisu. I can feel it.

這是全世界
It's the last bit of dragon magic

僅存的龍之魔法
left in the whole world.

我理解龍心族 為什麼這麼嚴密地守護它了
I see why Heart guards it so closely.

謝謝你 這真是幫上我的大忙了
Thank you, dep la. You've been very helpful.

在另一個世界裏 我們也許能成為朋友
In a different world, maybe we could have been friends,

但現在我必須做對龍牙族有利的事
but I have to do what's right for Fang.

維拉納酋長 很高興龍牙族接受了我們的邀請
Chief Virana, I'm so glad Fang accepted our invitation.

你不可能帶走希蘇的龍珠
There is no way you're taking Sisu's gem.

不好意思 現在是龍牙的龍珠了
Sorry. It's Fang's now.

我不會讓你們踏入龍珠陣內圈一步
You will not set foot on the Dragon Gem's inner circle.

這是怎麼回事
What's going on?

怎麼回事
What is this?

龍牙族想要搶走龍珠
Fang's making a play for the gem!

不 龍珠應該歸我們龍脊族
No! Spine should have the gem!

我們肯定會先拿到手
Not if we get to it first!

我們的劍可不答應
Our blades say different.

聽我說
Listen to me!

我們有一個選擇
We have a choice.

我們可以相互廝殺
We can tear each other apart,

也可以團結起來 建立一個更美好的世界
or we can come together and build a better world.

現在還不算太晚
It's not too late.

我仍然相信 我們可以再次成為龍佑之邦
I still believe we can be Kumandra again.

爸
Ba!

別擋道兒
Out of my way!

龍珠屬於龍脊族
The gem belongs to Spine!

把龍珠給我
Give me the gem!

不…
No... No...

莊魔
Druun.

那裏面仍然有魔力
There's still magic in them!

-快拿上碎片 -不
- Get the pieces! - No!

爸 快點 我們得離開
Ba! Come on, we have to go!

他們不敢碰水
They're repelled by water.

快 去河邊
Hurry! Get to the river!

爸 快起來
Ba, get up! Come on!

我們得繼續跑
Please, we have to keep moving.

快起來
Get up!

爸 我們沒時間了
Ba! We don't have time!

站起來 我會幫你…
Stand up! I'll help...

拉雅 聽我說
Raya, you have to listen.

你才是龍珠守護者
You are the Guardian of the Dragon Gem.

爸 你說這個幹什麼
Ba, why are you saying this?

這裏還有光 還有希望
There's still light in this. There's still hope.

不 我們可以一起守護它們
No! We can make it together.

你能行的
You're okay.

拉雅 不要放棄他們
Raya. Don't give up on them.

我愛你 我的露珠
I love you, my dewdrop.

爸
Ba?

不
No!

爸
Ba!

爸
Ba.

 龍尾部落 六年後 

希望就是這裏
Please let this be it.

你在幹什麼 你這個大皮蟲
What are you doing, you big fur bug?

夥計 集中精力
Hey, buddy, focus.

眼睛看前面 圖圖
Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk.

好孩子
Good boy.

你太容易分心了
You're so easily distracted.

哥們兒 你太大了 不能再這樣了
You're getting a little too big for this, bud.

搜尋了六年
Six years of searching

最後就找到了一艘沉船
and we end up at a literal shipwreck.

這不是一個壞兆頭吧
That's not a bad sign, is it?

希蘇達圖
Sisudatu...

我不知道你能否聽到
I don't know if you're listening.

為了找到你 我搜尋了每一條河
I've searched every river to find you,

這是最後一條河
and now I'm here at the very last one.

活著的人已經不多了
Look, there's not a lot of us left,

我們真的需要你的幫助
and we really... We really need your help.

說實話吧
If I can be honest,

我自己也真的需要你的幫助
I really need your help.

我犯了一個錯誤
I made a mistake.

我信任了一個不該信的人 然後…
I trusted someone I shouldn't have, and...

整個世界都崩潰了
...now the world's broken.

希蘇達圖
Sisudatu...

我真希望我爸能回來
I just really, really want my ba back.

求你了
Please.

好
Okay...

開始
Here goes everything.

如意 如意
Suvaa de draa sim

按我心意
Mandra de draa lim

快快顯靈
Bavaa de draa Tomben

我知道 夥計 我沒忘…
I know, buddy, I haven't forgot...

天啊 我在哪
Oh, my... Where am I?

盤谷 安巴 普拉妮 你們在嗎
Pengu? Amba? Pranee? Are you here?

強大的希蘇
Oh, Mighty Sisu.

誰在說話
Who said that?

你好
Hello?

你好
Hello?

哦
Oh!

對不起 我沒看見你
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

沒事 你只是沾上了一點土
Not too bad. Just a little dusty.

我幫你拍拍
Let me get that for ya.

希蘇
Sisu?

你是希蘇
You are Sisu?

你是人
And you're people.

你叫什麼名字
What's your name?

拉雅 我是拉雅
Raya. I'm Raya.

而且你不是石頭人 也就是說…
And you're not made of stone, which means...

它成功了
It worked!

我們做到了
We did it!

你聽到了嗎 盤谷 成功了
You hear that, Pengu? It worked!

我沒有搞砸
I didn't mess it up!

那是食物嗎
Is that food?

我忙著拯救世界
I was so focused on saving the world,

今天忘記吃早餐了
I forgot to have breakfast today.

今天
Today?

你覺得今天是哪天啊
When exactly do you think today is?

週二
Tuesday.

我是說…真好吃
I mean... Mmm.

這美味的零食是什麼
What is this delightful culinary treat?

是菠蘿蜜干 我自己曬的
It's jackfruit jerky. I dried it myself.

你的廚藝真是太好了
Well, compliments to the chef.

剩下的給你吃吧 小子
Wanna finish this, Skippy?

呃…
Uh...

希蘇 有些事我要告訴你
Sisu, there are a few things I need to catch you up on.

什麼
Oh, yeah?

你打碎了
You broke it?

天啊 不好了 太糟糕了
Oh, oh. Oh, my. This is bad. This is bad.

我睡了500年
I've been asleep for 500 years,

你讓莊魔回來了
you brought back the Druun,

但我的兄弟姐妹都沒有回來
and none of my brothers and sisters came back.

他們為什麼不回來
Why didn't they come back?

我不知道
I don't know.

你還打碎了龍珠
Also, you broke the gem!

我還有一大塊兒呢
But I still have a big chunk of it, though.

你覺得這能讓我高興點嗎
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

如果你丟了一隻小狗 我說
If you lost a puppy, and I said...

「但我們還有一大塊兒呢」
"Well, we still have a big chunk of it!"

這能讓你高興點嗎
Would that make you feel better?

你不能再做一個嗎
Can't you just make another one?

不 我不能就這麼「再做一個」
No, I can't just "make another one."

但你是一條龍啊
But you're a dragon.

跟你說實話吧
I'm gonna be real with you, all right?

我不是最好的龍
I'm not, like, the best dragon, ya know?

但是你拯救了世界
But you saved the world.

確實是我幹的 這是真的
I did do that. That's true.

但是你做過小組項目嗎
But have you ever done like a group project,

小組裏總有個孩子
but there's, like, that one kid

沒怎麼幹活
who didn't pitch in as much,

但還是拿到一樣的分數了
but still ended up with the same grade?

其實真正製造龍珠的不是我
Yeah, I wasn't the one who actually made the gem.

我只是把它拿出來了
I just turned it in.

哇
Whoa. Uh...

你在發光
You're glowing.

謝謝
Oh, thank you.

我用蘆薈和河泥來保養我的…
I use aloe and river slime to maintain my...

不是 看
No, no. Look!

這是我妹妹安巴的魔力
Oh! This is my little sister Amba's magic.

我得到了她的光芒
I got the glow!

你妹妹的魔力
Your little sister's magic?

對 每條龍都有獨特的魔力
Yeah, every dragon has a unique magic.

那你的魔力是什麼
Okay, what's yours?

我特別擅長游泳
I'm a really strong swimmer.

等等 你拿起了龍珠
Wait, wait, wait, you touched this gem piece

它就給了你力量
and it gave you powers.

你知道這意味著什麼嗎
You know what this means, right?

我不再需要夜燈了
I no longer need a night light?

什麼 不是 你仍然跟龍珠的魔力相連
What? No! You're still connected to the gem's magic,

也就是說你仍然能使用它
and that means you can still use it

拯救世界
to save the world.

如果我們拿到所有的龍珠碎片
If we can get all the other gem pieces...

-我就可以復原它 -你就可以復原它
- I can reassemble it... - ...you can reassemble it...

-再把莊魔趕走 -再把莊魔趕走
...and boom the Druun away!

能把我爸帶回來嗎
And bring my ba back?

能把龍佑之邦所有人帶回來
And bring all of Kumandra back.

納瑪莉公主
Princess Namaari,

龍尾部落已經被莊魔入侵了
the Tail lands are infested with Druun.

班加的女兒在這裏就跟石頭一樣 毫無威脅
Benja's daughter is as good as stone out here.

她就會看毫無用處的龍卷軸
Retrieving some useless dragon scroll

不值得為她冒險
isn't worth the risk.

還有人質疑為什麼來這裏嗎
Anyone else wanna question why we're out here?

情況是這樣的
Okay, so here's the sitch.

龍珠破碎後 五個部落的酋長
After the gem broke, each piece was taken

每人都拿到了一片碎片
by one of the chiefs of the five lands,

龍牙 龍心 龍脊 龍爪和龍尾
Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail.

我們現在就在龍尾部落
Where we are now.

我有很多問題
Wow. So many questions.

第一個 我為什麼要穿成這樣
First one, why am I wearing this?

因為我們不想引起別人的注意
Well, we don't want to attract attention.

那這頂帽子你真是選對了
Oh, you definitely chose the right hat for that.

你為什麼覺得龍尾族的酋長在這裏
So, what makes you think the Tail chief's here?

因為這裏不僅僅是個陷阱
Because this place didn't just booby-trap itself.

這說不通啊
This doesn't make sense.

這些可擋不住莊魔
None of this would stop a Druun.

不是為了擋住莊魔 而是擋住人
It's not to stop Druun. It's to stop people.

怎麼了
What?

你為什麼這樣看著我
Why are you looking at me like that?

沒什麼
Nothing.

只是還不習慣看到龍
I'm just not used to seeing dragons.

大開眼界吧 你還沒見過我仰泳呢
Impressed, huh? Wait until you see my backstroke.

我在水裏真是厲害極了
I'm wicked when I hit that liquid.

水中技能特別棒
I got water skills that kill.

一入水簡直是大殺四方 無人能及
I slaughter when I hit the water.

我真的很擅長游泳 節奏無敵
I'm, like, really good at swimming, through rhyme.

我就是想表達
I was trying to make that...

我真的很會游泳
That I'm really good at swim...

我是一名優秀的游泳者 這就是我
I'm a good swimmer, is basically what I'm...

好的 我們得繼續前進
Okay, um, we need to keep going.

-哦 不 -什麼 是什麼
- Oh, no! - What? What is it?

我們忘了給龍尾酋長帶禮物了
We forgot to bring a gift for the Tail chief.

什麼 禮物
I'm sorry. A gift?

對 禮物 表達的是：
Yeah. A gift says,

「你可以信任我 我可以信任你嗎 」
"You can trust me, can I trust you?"

你好呀 小傢伙
Aw. Hey there, little fella.

這只甲蟲屁股還挺翹
This beetle's got a booty.

小心點 這是嘟嘟炸
Uh... Careful. It's a Toot N Boom.

為什麼叫…
Why is it called a...

知道了 明白 有道理
Got it. Noted. Makes sense.

呃…
Uh...

不過你得承認
You have to admit though,

這些蟲屁股真是挺可愛的
these bug booties are kind of cute.

這應該就是龍尾酋長了
I'd say we found the Tail chief.

怎麼回事
What happened to her?

看起來
From the looks of it,

她為了保住龍珠
she was hoarding the gem

成了自己陷阱的受害人
and became a victim of her own traps.

好吧 還是得佩服她的責任心
Well, you gotta admire her commitment.

好了 抓緊
Okay. Hold on.

哦 我們應該跳過去是嗎
Oh, we were doing a jumpy thing!

對不起 我的錯
So sorry. My bad.

現在我明白了
I get it now. I'm with it.

希蘇
Sisu...

別碰
don't.

拿到兩塊了 還有三塊
Two down, three to go.

我變形了 變成人了
I just shapechanged! Into people!

龍能變成人
Dragons can do that?

這是我妹妹普拉妮的魔法
This was my sister Pranee's thing.

看看我的人手 我的人臉
Look at my people arms and my people face.

看我屁股離腦袋有多近
Look how close my butt is to my head.

現在你就不用把我藏起來了
Now that you don't have to hide me,

拿到剩下的龍珠碎片簡直易如反掌
getting the rest of the gems is gonna be a breeze.

這次確實很簡單
Yeah, well, this one was easy,

但剩下的碎片
but the rest of them are being held

都被一堆不好惹的混蛋守著
by a bunch of no-good binturis.

混蛋
Binturi?

這樣描述老朋友可不太好
That's not a very nice way to describe an old friend.

納瑪莉
Namaari.

最近怎麼樣 姐妹
What's drippin', dep la?

哎呀 你終於交到新朋友了
Oh, I see you've finally made a new friend.

我本來還擔心
And here I was worried

你會變成那種孤獨的養貓女人
you were gonna end up becoming a cat lady

像我一樣
like me.

感覺你們不太像閨蜜
Something tells me you're not besties.

你們是來偷龍珠碎片的 為什麼
Stealing Dragon Gem pieces, are we? Why?

能說什麼呢 我就喜歡亮閃閃的東西
What can I say? Bling is my thing.

我得承認 拉雅 直到幾個月前
I gotta admit, Raya, until a few months ago,

我都一直以為你變成石頭了
I thought you were stone.

但是後來 有人偷走了龍牙族的龍卷軸
But then, someone stole Fang's dragon scroll.

這就是你追我的原因
Oh, is that why you're chasing me?

我還以為是因為你想我了
And here I thought it was because you missed me.

你真的在找希蘇嗎
Are you really looking for Sisu?

你是12歲的小孩嗎
What are you, 12?

對 我真的在找希蘇
Yeah, I actually was looking for Sisu.

你猜怎麼著 我找到她了
Oh, and guess what? I found her.

希蘇 打個招呼
Say hi, Sisu.

你好
Hi!

很高興見到你
It's very nice to meet you,

我喜歡你的髮型 還有你的貓…的髮型
and I love your hair and your cats' hair.

抓住她們
Take them.

快跑
Run!

不是這樣 兩條腿跑
Not like that! Two legs!

對
Right!

圖圖 快滾
Tuk Tuk! Roll!

跳
Jump!

那個女孩是誰
Who was that girl?

納瑪莉
That's Namaari.

她就是那個毀掉世界的卑鄙混蛋
She's the backstabbing binturi that broke the world.

那些貓速度真快
Wow, those cats are really fast, huh?

貓和莊魔有什麼共同點
What do cats and Druun have in common?

呃...都沒有靈魂
Um... They have no souls?

而且都討厭水
And they both hate water.

抓緊了
- Oh. - Hold on!

有人嗎
Hello? Is anybody here?

歡迎來到舉世聞名的蝦館
Welcome to the world-famous Shrimp-orium.

我是波弟 由我為兩位服務

Toi, that's a lot of jade!

預付一半 到了龍爪部落再給剩下的 成交
Half now, half when we arrive in Talon. Deal?

波弟船長
Uh, Captain Boun?

這東西能走快點兒嗎
Does this thing go any faster?

你沒說龍牙族在追你們啊
Whoa! You didn't tell me Fang was after you!

這得加錢
This is gonna cost you extra!

別擔心 讓我來
Don't worry, I got it.

她在幹什麼
What is she doing?

怎麼回事
What is happening?

我朋友特別擅長游泳
My friend's a really strong swimmer.

再見 混蛋們
Bye-bye, binturi.

納瑪莉公主 如果她們是去找龍珠碎片的
Princess Namaari, if they're after gem pieces,

那下一站肯定是龍爪部落
their next stop would be Talon.

我們不能跟著她們去龍爪
We're not following them to Talon.

我們要回龍牙
We're going back to Fang.

我要跟維拉納酋長談談
I need to speak with Chief Virana.

希蘇
Sisu? Sisu?

請從水裏上來
Please get out of there.

我是水龍
I'm a water dragon.

這是水 這就是我的地方
This is water. It's sort of my thing.

你想下來嗎
You wanna come in?

你會被人發現的
Someone could see you.

你是說那個霹靂舞船長嗎
Oh. Do you mean Captain Pop and Lock over there?

你怕什麼
What, are you scared

怕他要跟我比舞嗎
he's gonna challenge me to a dance battle?

希蘇 我見識過 人類為了龍珠
Sisu, I saw people lose their minds

能變得多瘋狂
over a Dragon Gem.

如果他們見到真正的龍 你能想像會發生什麼嗎
Can you imagine what they'd do over an actual dragon?

你是整個計劃的重點
Look, we need you to make this all work.

在找到所有碎片前 你要一直保持人形
Until we have all the gems, you have to stay human.

拜託了
Please.

看來你確實有些信任問題啊
Wow, you really got some trust issues.

我父親就盲目地信任他人
Look, my father blindly trusted people,

於是他變成石頭了
and now, he's stone.

我們會把你爸變回來的
Hey, we'll get your ba back.

有我呢 姑娘 誰是你的龍
I got you, girl. Come on, who's your dragon?

我是說「誰是你的人」 因為我會一直當人 直到…
I mean, human. Because I'm gonna be a human until...

你明白的
Yeah, you... You get it.

誰餓了
Okay, who's hungry?

我餓了
Oh, I am.

兩份蝦館特色粥 要多辣
Two house specials. How spicy would you like it?

辣 特辣 還是波弟變態辣
Hot, hotter, or Boun-goes-the-dynamite?

-我要吃辣 -不
- Bring on the heat! - Yeah, no.

不行
No, I don't think so.

你在幹什麼
Uh, what are you doing?

我們不認識他 這可能有毒
We don't know him. It could be poison.

他為什麼要給我們下毒
Why would he poison us?

對啊 我為什麼要給你們下毒
Yeah, why would I poison you?

首先 你想要我的玉包
First, to get my jade purse,

第二 偷我的劍
second, to steal my sword,

第三 不知道 可能是綁架我的圖圖
and third, I don't know, to kidnap my Tuk Tuk.

有道理 但如果這是毒藥…
All good points, but if this is poison...

那肯定會讓你死於幸福
...you're gonna die happy.

不了 謝謝 我們有吃的
Yeah, thanks, but we got our own eats.

太好吃了
This is delicious.

順便說一句 沒毒
By the way, not poison.

但是…
But it's...

好辣
It's hot. Ooh, it's hot!

好辣 太辣了
It's hot! It's really hot!

天啊 水
Oh, my! Oh! Water!

波弟 波弟船長 甲板上需要水
Boun? Captain Boun? We need water on deck!

我知道 夥計
I know, buddy.

你知道嗎 白天的時候
You know, during the day,

你幾乎能忘掉它們的存在
you can almost forget they're here,

但是到了晚上…
but at night...

這就是為什麼我從不離開我的船
This is why I never leave the boat.

你是個聰明的孩子
You're a smart kid.

莊魔到底是什麼
What are Druun, anyways?

瘟疫 是從人類的紛爭中孕育而生的
A plague. Born from human discord.

它們一直都在
They've always been here.

等到人類脆弱的時刻 就大舉進攻
Waiting for a moment of weakness to attack.

它們就像是龍的反面
They're like the opposite of dragons.

龍給世界帶來水和生機
Instead of bringing water and life to the world,

而莊魔就像無情的火
they're like a relentless fire

所到之處 所有生命都被吞噬
that consumes everything in its wake

只剩下灰燼和石頭
until there's nothing left except ash and stone.

它們奪走了我的家人
They took my family.

也奪走了我的家人
They took mine, too.

我們到了
Looks like we're here.

你們在龍爪的事辦完之後要去哪裏
So, where are you guys heading after Talon?

我可能也要去那裏
I might be heading there, too.

當然了 你們得付錢
I mean, for a fee, of course.

當然
Of course.

這樣的房子能防莊魔 真聰明
Wow! What a smart way to Druun-proof your house.

直接在水上建房
Build right on the water.

龍爪族的人真是天才
People of Talon are geniuses.

龍爪人看起來挺好
Yeah. Talon may look nice,

但這裏其實是小偷和騙子最多的地方
but it's a hotspot for pickpockets and con artists.

算我走運 口袋空空
Lucky for me. Empty pockets!

好消息是
Okay, so here's the good news.

我知道龍珠碎片在哪裏
I know where the gem piece is.

壞消息就是
The bad news?

它是由臭名昭著的 龍爪族酋長親自收藏的
It's being held by the notorious Chief of Talon,

鄧海
Dang Hai.

他所有的短板 都靠壞來補齊了
What Dang Hai lacks in style, he makes up in mean.

明白了
Gotcha.

現在我們只要展現魅力就好
Now, we're just gonna have to turn up the charm.

先去給他買個禮物
Let's go get him a gift.

希蘇 我覺得你應該留在船上
Sisu, I think maybe it's safer for you

這樣更安全
to stay here on the boat.

什麼
What?

沒有你 我們就沒法把龍珠復原
Without you, we can't put the gem back together.

但我也想幫忙
But I wanna help.

我知道 你能幫上忙
I know, and you will.

你安全了就是幫忙了
By staying safe.

我很快就會回來
I'll be back before you know it.

如果有人餓了 就送來給我
If you see any hungry faces, send 'em my way.

沒問題 船長
You got it, Captain.

好 這就是鄧海的房子
All right, there's Dang Hai's house.

直接去拿龍珠 絕對不能走偏
No detours till we score that Dragon Gem.

這是…
Whoa. What in the...

好吧
Okay.

嘿 嬰兒 小孩兒 你…
Hey, baby, toddler, thing...

不管你是什麼
...whatever you're called.

這麼晚了 你在這裏幹什麼
It's really late. What are you doing out here?

你父母在哪裏
Where are your parents?

喂 誰家丟孩子了
Hey, uh, whose baby...

什麼 猴吉吉
What? Ongis?

給我放下
Drop 'em!

不是吧 一個嬰兒騙子
Really? A con-baby?

我有不好的預感
Ah, this is giving me bad feels.

鄧海酋長不是那種
Chief Dang Hai does not sound like

靠好聽的話就能說服的人
someone you could smooth talk.

而且拉雅連禮物都沒帶
And Raya didn't even bring a gift.

決定了 我要去購物
That's it. I'm going shopping.

等等 我沒錢
Oh, wait. I don't have any money.

你是個成年人
You're an adult.

你可以記賬
You could just put it on credit.

好哎 記賬是什麼
Oh... Uh, what's credit?

這有點像一個保證
It's kinda like a promise.

你先拿走想要的東西
You take what you want now,

並且保證以後會來付錢
and you promise you'll pay it back later.

先消費 後付錢
Pay it back later? Huh!

真是個了不起的觀念
What an amazing concept.

謝謝 波弟船長
Thanks, Captain Boun.

我要記賬買這個
I'll be buying this with credit.

鄧海肯定喜歡這個
Oh, Dang Hai's gonna love this!

記賬 謝謝
Credit, please.

我喜歡 記我賬上
Oh, I like that. Uh, yeah, I'll be using credit, yes.

我愛記賬
I love credit!

喂 你
Hey, you!

這些你打算付錢嗎
Are you going to pay for any of that?

哦
Oh!

不 這些是記賬的
Right, right. No, this is on credit.

對 我以後再付錢
Yeah, I'm gonna pay it back later.

以後付錢 我們不認識你
Pay us back later? We don't know you.

你在這裏沒帳可記
You have no credit here.

-現在就付錢 -現在
- Pay us right now. - Now?

我什麼都沒有
I don't have anything,

但是如果能找到我閨蜜拉雅
but if I could just find my girl Raya,

她有劍 有零食
she has a sword, dried eats,

還有兩塊龍珠碎片
two Dragon Gem pieces.

不對 我們沒有龍珠 誰說有了
No, we don't! What? Who said that?

你最好立刻付錢 小偷
You better pay up, binturi.

這不是慈善機構
This isn't a charity.

你居然敢從我這裏偷東西
Who do you think you're stealing from?

離她遠點
Get away from her!

看不出來她是新來的嗎
Can't you see she's new in town?

過來 親愛的 別怕
Come, dear. Don't be afraid.

沒事了
It's okay.

小心點
Hey, watch out!

再見
Bye!

尿布
Diaper!

謝了
Thanks.

雖然這不關我的事
So, it's none of my business,

但是用你的寶寶魅力去騙人…
but using your baby charm to rip people off...

真是太有心機了
...is super sketchy.

好吧 你的家人在哪裏
All right, where is your family?

哦
Oh...

知道了
Right.

嘿
Hey.

你們想不想掙點乾淨錢
How would you like to earn some honest loot?

好了 鄧海
All right, Dang Hai,

那塊龍珠碎片交給我就行了
I'll take that Dragon Gem piece.

我不是鄧海
Whoa! I'm not Dang Hai.

我是阿茶 花匠
I'm Chai, the flower guy.

鄧海在哪
Where is Dang Hai?

他就在那裏
He's right over there.

什麼 那誰拿走了他的龍珠碎片
What? Who has his gem piece?

龍爪族有史以來
The most vicious chief

最惡毒的酋長
Talon has ever seen.

那些人也太瘋狂了
Those folks were, like, crazy mad.

我只是想給鄧海酋長
I just wanted to bring some gifts

帶點禮物
to the Talon chief Dang Hai.

親愛的 你是要找鄧海嗎
Is that who you're looking for, dear?

我知道他在哪裏
I know exactly where he is.

你知道
You do?

嗯 我帶你去
Mm-hmm. I will take you there.

這就是我一直跟我閨蜜拉雅說的
See? That's what I've been trying to tell my girl Raya.

但她一直說： 「你不能信任別人
And she's all like, "You can't trust people."

不要跟陌生人說話
"Don't talk to anyone."

我只吃自己曬的難吃食物」
"I only eat terrible foods I dried myself."

來吧 親愛的
Come, dear.

鄧海酋長就在城外
Chief Dang Hai is just outside the city,

出了城門就到
beyond the gates.

居然不住在水上
Away from the water, huh? Wow.

他一定很喜歡冒險
He really likes living on the edge.

你好 鄧海
Hi there, Dang Hai.

我是希蘇
Um, I'm Sisu,

我給你帶了一些…
and I've come here to offer you some...

呃…
Uh...

好了 現在告訴我
Now, you're gonna tell me

去哪能找到其他的龍珠碎片
where I can find those other Dragon Gem pieces,

否則我就把你留給那些東西
or I'll have to leave you outside with that thing.

你選吧
Take your pick.

但是我…我信任了你
But I... I trusted you.

大錯特錯
Big mistake.

你最好快點說
You better talk fast.

它好像很餓
It looks hungry.

不
No. No, no. No, no, no!

拉雅
Raya!

攔住她
Stop her!

希蘇 我讓你留在船上
Sisu, I told you to stay on the boat.

對不起
Sorry!

抓住這個 好嗎
Hold on to this for me, will ya?

霧
Fog?

對 這是我哥哥賈格的魔法
Yeah. That was my brother Jagan's magic.

好 拿到三個了 還剩兩個
Okay. Three down, two to go.

好了 波弟船長 下一站 龍脊…
All right, Captain Boun, next stop, Spine...

謝謝你帶來的新客人
Thanks for the new customers!

對了 我答應過
Yeah, I sort of promised to buy them

粥隨便他們吃 我來付錢
all the congee they could eat.

那他們要在這裏待一陣子了
Well, we're stuck with them for a while

因為猴吉吉有九個胃
'cause ongis have nine stomachs.

天啊
Oh, toi.

我難以相信
I can't believe it.

那個老太太真的要傷害我
That old lady was really gonna hurt me.

很抱歉 希蘇
Well, I'm sorry, Sisu,

現在的世界就是這個樣子
but that's what the world is now.

你不能相信任何人
You can't trust anyone.

也包括嬰兒嗎
Does that include babies?

她好可愛
- Uh, well... - She's so cute.

看看這小臉蛋兒
I mean, look at those cheeks.

嗨 我是希蘇
Hi, I'm Sisu.

她喜歡我的臉
She loves my face.

是啊 小心別讓她偷走你的牙
Yeah, watch out she doesn't steal your teeth.

來 讓我幫你
Here, let me help you.

啊 太可愛了
Oh, that's so sweet.

好吧 夠了 可愛過分了
Okay, that's, uh... That's too much sweet...

可愛過頭了 行了
Too much sweetness. It's too much!

 龍牙部落 

維拉納酋長 我們的空間快要不夠了
Chief Virana, we're running out of room.

我們需要擴張到大陸
We need to expand to the mainland.

那你覺得我們要怎麼對付莊魔呢
And how do you propose we handle the Druun,

阿蒂塔亞將軍
General Atitāya?

如果沒有足夠的保護
Without proper protection,

這對我們的人民來說就是死刑
it would be a death sentence for our people.

母親 我應該有解決辦法
I might have a solution for that, Mother.

我的小晨霧
My little morning mist...

你回來了可真好
Oh, it's good to see you home.

我找到了拉雅 她在偷龍珠碎片
I located Raya. She's out stealing gem pieces.

什麼
What?

我想帶著皇家部隊
I'd like to take the royal army

去龍脊部落攔截她
and intercept her in Spine.

如果她要去龍脊部落
Well, if she's going into Spine,

那她在路上應該就被吃干抹淨了
I doubt there'll be much left of her to intercept.

她比你想得要強大
She's more capable than you realize.

我們必須阻止她
We have to stop her.

跟我去走走
Walk with me.

看看周圍
Look around.

我們能有今天 靠的是做出明智的決定
We made all this by making smart decisions,

而不是情緒化的決定
not emotional ones.

我們很安全
We are safe.

運河保護我們不受怪物傷害
Our canal protects us from those monsters.

我認為除非到了緊要關頭
I don't think it's wise to risk yourself

否則不應該冒險
when you don't have to.

但是你聽到將軍的話了
But you heard the general.

我們的空間不夠了 需要擴張
We're running out of space. We need to expand.

如果我們能得到所有龍珠碎片 就能安全地擴張了
If we had all the gem pieces, we could do that safely.

你說的對
You're right.

這不是一個情緒化的決定
This isn't an emotional decision.

如果想要確保龍牙族的未來
It's the only decision we can make

這就是唯一的選擇
to secure Fang's future.

納瑪莉 你真的長大了
Namaari, you're truly growing

成了一名領袖 跟我期望的一樣
into the leader I raised you to be.

阿蒂亞亞將軍 集結皇家部隊
General Atitāya, ready the royal army

聽我女兒的號令
for my daughter's command.

謝謝母親 我不會讓你失望的
Thank you, Mother. I won't let you down.

喂 別吃了
Hey! Stop eating!

抱歉了 夥計 我來處理
Sorry, buddy, I got this.

你是不是拿蝦砸我了
Did you just throw a shrimp at me?

那個根本不能吃
That's not even edible!

-嘿 -別這樣看著我
- Hey! - Don't look at me...

嘿 夥計們
Uh... Hey, guys?

你們這群長毛的垃圾桶
...like that, you fuzzy garbage can!

你們想玩捉迷藏嗎
Do you wanna play hide-and-seek?

好的 準備好了嗎
All right. Ready?

一
One.

二
Two.

-謝謝 -二點五
- Thanks. - Two and a half.

三
Three.

記得提醒我 永遠別生孩子
Remind me to never have kids.

做人太難了
Being people is hard.

是啊
Yep.

六
Six.

七
Seven.

你們腦袋這麼小
You have small heads.

沒有尾巴
No tails.

靠撒謊得到想要的東西
You lie to get what you want,

就像之前的龍爪酋長一樣
like the Talon chief back there.

是啊 世界已經完蛋了
Yeah, well, the world's broken.

你不能相信任何人
You can't trust anyone.

也許就是因為你們不信任別人
Or maybe the world's broken

世界才完蛋的
because you don't trust anyone.

你聽起來就像我爸
You sound just like my ba.

那他應該是個聰明人
Well, he sounds like a smart man.

他是很聰明
Yeah, he was.

我真的很想相信他
I really wanted to believe him.

我真的很想相信
I really wanted to believe

我們可以再次成為龍佑之邦
that we could be Kumandra again.

我們可以
And we can.

成千上萬人已經石化了
Literally thousands of people turned to stone

他們持反對意見
would argue otherwise.

但這不意味著你就不能去試試了
That doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

我試過了 你知道發生了什麼嗎
And I did. And you know what happened?

我被送我禮物的人從背後踢了一腳
I got kicked in the back by someone who gave me a gift.

看看周圍
Look around.

這世界到處都是孤兒
We're a world of orphans because

就是因為人類無法停止爭奪龍珠
people couldn't stop fighting over a gem.

想知道為什麼其他龍沒有回來嗎
Wanna know why other dragons didn't come back?

因為人類不配擁有他們
It's because people don't deserve them.

但是你可以改變這一點
But you can change that.

不 希蘇 我不想再嘗試了
No, Sisu, I am done trying.

龍佑之邦只是一個童話
Kumandra is a fairy tale.

現在對我來說唯一重要的事情
The only thing important to me now

就是讓我爸回來
is bringing my ba back.

我們好像到龍脊部落了
Um... I think we're in Spine.

希蘇
Sisu!

我的粥
Hey, my congee!

你待在這裏 我馬上回來
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

 龍脊部落 

希蘇 快回來
Sisu! Come back! Please!

你在幹什麼
What... What are you doing?

我要讓你看看你是錯的
I'm going to show you that you're wrong!

你要怎麼做 被一群憤怒的龍脊人砸扁嗎
How? By getting squashed by a bunch of Spine rage-heads?

不
No.

我要向你證明
By proving to you

如果想得到別人的信任
that if you wanna get someone's trust,

就要先信任別人
you have to give a little trust first.

等等 希蘇 不要…
Wait, Sisu, don't...

現在看來 也許我是有點草率
In hindsight, maybe I was a little hasty,

但是 你餓嗎
but, uh, who's hungry?

不餓 那我不煩你了
No? I'll leave you alone.

我們這是在哪
Okay, where are we?

這個住所真有趣
Interesting choice of digs.

你們兩個一定是豬腦袋
You two must be dung of brain

居然想偷龍脊族的龍珠
to think you could steal Spine's Dragon Gem.

龍珠
Gem?

誰提過龍珠了
Who said anything about gems?

我們對龍珠不感興趣
We have no interest in gems.

好吧 確實
Okay, yeah, I can see how

這讓我看起來像個騙子
that makes me look like a liar.

其實我認為
Actually, I think it was the lying

是撒謊讓你看起來像個騙子
that made you look like a liar.

我不知道有什麼好笑的
I'm not sure what's funny.

你們的恐懼就像甜美的花蜜
Your fear is like delectable nectar

能餵飽我靈魂的小肚肚
feeding the tum-tum of my soul.

很好吃
It's good.

味道像…芒果
Tastes like... mango.

我愛芒果
Oh. I love mango.

當然了
Of course you love mango!

只有沒舌頭的蠢貨才不愛芒果
Only a tongue-less cretin wouldn't.

天啊
Oh, toi!

我已經很久很久沒有
It's been such a long time since I've last peered

盯著一個驚恐敵人的眼睛了
into the eyes of a trembling enemy.

時間都去哪了
Where has the time gone?

已經太久了
It's been so long.

他好像很孤獨
He seems lonely.

不 我才不孤獨
No! I'm not lonely.

我是一個龍脊族武士
I'm a Spine warrior.

我生來就只有一個使命
I was born and bred to do only one thing.

那就是喚起恐懼
To invoke fear

並粉碎敵人的頭顱
and to crush the skulls of my enemies!

這是兩件事了
That's actually two things.

看看你的表情
Look at your face.

你打算拿我們怎麼辦
Hey. What do you plan on doing with us?

會很糟糕
Oh, it's gonna be bad.

非常恐怖
Horrifying!

我事後得花兩個星期來清理
It'll take me two weeks to clean up!

你不知道怎麼辦 對嗎
You have no idea, do you?

不 我知道
Yes, I do.

我正在腦子裏制定這個恐怖的計劃
I'm formulating this gruesome plan in my head...

想想就覺得噁心
Makes me sick just thinking about it.

你們就等著吧
You... You just wait.

等的時候 你們可以隨便掛掛
Until then, why don't you just hang around?

這個笑話不錯吧
Good one, huh?

一個小傢伙
A little one?

不錯
All right!

幹得好 波弟船長
Phew! Good work, Captain Boun!

-龍牙族的來了 -什麼
- Fang's here! - What?

龍脊族的聽好了 我們在找拉雅
People of Spine, we are hunting for Raya,

她是從龍心族來的逃犯
a fugitive from Heart!

把她交出來 否則我們就攻進去
Send her out, or we're coming in!

這裏只有你一個嗎
You're the only one here?

我的人民與莊魔英勇作戰
My people battled the Druun with much valor,

但是都沒回來
but lost.

好吧
Okay.

龍牙族是來抓我的 不是來抓你們
But the Fang gang's here for me, not for you,

所以 如果我能吸引他們的注意力
so, um, if I can distract them,

你們就可以趁機離開
then you guys can get out of here.

你要自己對抗一支軍隊
You're gonna fight an entire army?

不 我只是要拖延他們
No, I'm just gonna stall them.

聽著 我知道怎麼對付納瑪莉
Look, I know how to push Namaari's buttons.

只要你們安全了 我就能逃跑
And once you guys are clear, I'm out of there.

你叫什麼名字
What's your name?

給我的綽號是阿堂
The moniker given to me is Tong.

好 阿堂 你不認識我
Okay, Tong, look, you don't know me,

我也不認識你
and I don't know you,

但你肯定知道後門
but I'm sure that you know a back door

或者其他能離開這裏的路
or a way outta here,

我一定要保證朋友的安全 這很重要
and it's really important that my friends stay safe, okay?

所以我真心請求你幫幫我們
So, I am sincerely asking you, will you help us?

可以嗎
Please.

好了
Okay.

我要記住
Note to self,

千萬別死
don't die.

放火逼他們出來
Burn them out.

嘿 插刀教公主
Hey there, Princess Undercut.

在這裏見到你真好
Fancy meeting you here.

你和龍珠碎片
You and the Dragon Gem pieces

都要跟我走
are coming with me.

我的劍可不同意
Hmm. My sword here says we're not.

我就知道你不會單打獨鬥
Yeah, I knew you couldn't handle rolling solo.

沒有幫手 你就什麼都不是
You're nothing without your band.

你們待命
Stand down.

這花不了多長時間
This shouldn't take long.

你需要這個嗎 姐妹
Did you need that, dep la?

不需要
Nah.

看來你一直在上課啊
Looks like somebody's been taking classes.

你為什麼要偷龍珠碎片
Why are you stealing gem pieces?

我就是想集齊整個系列
Oh, I'm just trying to get a matching set.

你不會碰巧帶了龍牙的龍珠吧
You didn't happen to bring Fang's gem, did you?

沒帶 沒關係
No? Never mind.

我之後再去你們那裏拿就好了
I'll just swing by and grab it later.

我可要好好享受一下了
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

對 她是一條龍
Yep, she's a dragon.

我們走吧
Let's go.

快點
Come on!

你是用蝦尾砸我了嗎
Did you just hit me with a shrimp tail?

你打算什麼時候 告訴我們她是希蘇
When were you gonna tell us she was Sisu?

嚴格地說 你們一直都知道她叫希蘇
Well, technically, you always knew she was Sisu.

不是吧
Seriously?

你為什麼在這裏
Why are you here,

神聖的水龍
divine water dragon?

這不是很明顯嗎 大個子
Isn't that obvious, big guy?

我閨蜜拉雅和我 要一起拯救世界
My girl Raya and I are gonna fix the world.

把所有人都帶回來
Bring everyone back.

你們要把所有人都帶回來
You're gonna bring everyone back?

我想幫忙
I wanna help.

很抱歉 我不能讓你參加
I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.

太危險了
It's too dangerous.

被莊魔石化家人的 可不只你一個
You're not the only one who lost family to the Druun.

求你了
Please.

讓我幫你們
Let me help you.

我也想加入這支隊伍
I too wish to join this fellowship

一起去踹莊魔的屁股
of Druun butt-kickery!

我哥哥盤谷的魔法
My big brother Pengu's magic.

好了 波弟船長 去龍牙部落
All right, Captain Boun. To Fang.

沒問題
You got it!

大家聽好 這是計劃
All right, everyone, here's the plan.

最後一塊龍珠碎片在龍牙部落
The last gem piece is in Fang,

在五個部落中 他們的守衛最嚴密
the most heavily guarded of the five lands.

他們有一條人工運河
Now, they're protected by an artificial canal

把他們與其他地方隔離開
that separates them from the rest of the world.

唯一的進去渠道
The only way in or out

就是走水路
is by water.

幸運的是 我們有一條神奇的水龍
Luckily for us, we have a magic water dragon.

宮殿裏佈滿了龍牙戰士
Now, the palace will be swarmingwith Fang soldiers.

要想繞過他們 我們要…
To sneak past them, we'll need to...

交給我吧 夥計們
I got this, guys.

第一波我來對付
I'll take care of the first wave.

然後是阿堂
Tong will follow up

還有他那把牛逼的巨斧
with hisgiant axe of bad-axery.

然後是猴吉吉和那個瘋狂的騙子寶寶
And then come the ongis and that crazy con-baby...

她會把龍珠扔給強大的希蘇達圖
...who will toss the gem to the Mighty Sisudatu.

再然後 拜拜了 混蛋們
And then, bye-bye, binturis.

超級流暢的計劃 對吧
Super flow plan, am I right?

不對 一點兒也不流暢 特別堵
Uh, no. Yeah, that's not flow. That's a clog.

同意
I agree.

我的計劃是這樣
Here's my plan.

我們滲透到龍牙內部
We infiltrate Fang,

面對納瑪莉
confront Namaari,

給她送個好禮物 然後說 
and offer her something nice and go...

嘿 想幫我們拯救世界嗎
Hey! Wanna help us save the world?

只要給我們一塊龍珠碎片就好
Because all it takes is one gem piece.

我願意
Yes!

我一直在等人這麼問我
I've been waiting for someone to ask me!

給你
Here you go!

我們是永遠的閨蜜
Best friends forever!

好吧 我寧願選波弟的計劃
Yeah, I think I'd rather go with Boun's plan.

什麼
What?

耶
Yes!

為什麼
What, why?

因為他們是龍牙族
Because it's Fang.

他們的劍都是經過特殊設計的
Their blades are specially designed

特別適合背後捅人
for the stabbing of backs.

如果不是他們
If it weren't for them,

這些都不會發生
none of this would have happened.

他們是最壞的
They're the worst.

我有一種感覺
If we're just honest with her,

如果我們跟她說實話
deep down, I got a feeling

那她也跟我們一樣 想拯救這個世界
she wants to fix the world as much as we do.

你沒見過納瑪莉背叛我的樣子
You weren't there when Namaari betrayed me.

我們按我的計劃來
We're sticking with my plan.

這大雨是怎麼回事
Whoa. Uh... What's with the downpour?

來吧 給你看樣東西
Come on! I need to show you something.

我們現在怎麼辦
So, what do we do now?

我不知道
I don't know.

你要帶我去哪
Where are you taking me?

 龍心部落 

希蘇 你帶我來這裏幹什麼
Sisu, why did you bring me here?

這就是一切發生的地方
This is where it all happened.

是的 我知道
Yeah, I know.

-我當時在場 -不
- I was there. - No.

這是500年前 一切發生的地方
This is where it all happened 500 years ago.

我想讓你見見我的兄弟姐妹
I want you to meet my brothers and sisters.

真正強大的龍
The real mighty ones.

我想念他們
I miss them.

我從來不知道他們在這裏
I never knew they were here.

看到那邊那條很優雅的龍了嗎
See that classy-looking one over there?

那是安巴 我從她那裏得到的光芒
That's Amba. I get my glow from her.

那是普拉妮 她是個變形者
And that's Pranee. She's a shapeshifter.

賈格 霧
Jagan, fog.

還有盤谷
And Pengu.

他是我們的大哥
He's our big brother.

他能帶來雨
He brings the rain.

我們是最後的龍
We were the last dragons.

其他的龍都石化了
All the other dragons had been turned to stone.

我們被無數的莊魔包圍了
We were drowning in a sea of Druun.

但是我大哥盤谷 拒絕認輸
But my oldest brother Pengu refused to accept defeat.

這是我們最後的抵抗
This is where we'd make our last stand...

所有龍一起
united.

所以 一個接一個
So, one by one,

他們結合了所有的魔法
they combined all their magic,

創造了龍珠
creating the Dragon Gem.

我不知道他們為什麼選擇我
I don't know why they chose me.

選我們中的任何一個都可以
It could have been any of us.

我只知道
All I know

我信任他們
is I trusted them...

他們也信任我
...and they trusted me.

所以…
And so...

當他們把命運托付給我時
When they put their faith in me,

也賦予了我強大無比的力量
it empowered me beyond anything I could imagine.

同樣的事也能發生在納瑪莉身上
The same can happen with Namaari.

我真希望我能相信
I really wish I could believe that.

我曾經以為我們可以成為朋友
I once thought that we could be friends.

經歷過這些
After all this,

也許你們可以做朋友
maybe you can be.

就算她想幫我們
Even if she wanted to help us,

我怎麼能相信她
how could I possibly trust her?

但如果你能相信她
But if somehow you could,

那你就不僅能帶你爸回來
you wouldn't just bring your ba back.

還能實現他的夢想
You'd also bring back his dream.

龍佑之邦
Kumandra.

你覺得他還能認出我嗎
Do you think he would even recognize me?

我變化這麼大
So much has changed.

他當然能
Of course he will.

你讓我想起了他
You remind me of him.

是嗎 我們一樣強壯
Oh, yeah? Strong?

帥氣 還有漂亮的頭髮
Good-looking with impeccable hair?

你們都充滿希望
Hopeful.

發生了這麼多事
How would I even approach Namaari

我要怎麼接近納瑪莉
after all that's happened?

你也許覺得這不可能 但有時候
It may feel impossible, but sometimes,

你甚至不需要做好準備
you just have to take the first step,

只需要邁出第一步
even before you're ready.

相信我
Trust me.

好的 我們按你的計劃來
Okay. We'll go with your plan.

什麼 我的計劃 你同意我的計劃
What? My plan? You're gonna go with my plan?

-是的 -太好了
- Yeah. - All right!

你不會後悔的
You're not gonna regret this.

我們需要準備一份貼心的禮物
But we're gonna need a really good gift.

你覺得她喜歡什麼 貓 刀
What do you think she's into? Cats? Knives?

帶刀的貓
Cats with knives?

畫著貓的刀
Knives with little cats on them?

其實我知道該給她送什麼
Actually, I know exactly what to give her.

雖然有那麼多怪物想摧毀我們
And that is how the land of Fang rose

但龍牙部落還是這樣崛起了
in spite of all the monsters that wanted to destroy us.

因為我們聰明 有韌性
Because we're smart, resilient,

而且會互相照顧
and we take care of one another.

母親 我們需要談談
Mother! We need to talk.

是納瑪莉公主
It's Princess Namaari!

好了 去玩吧 小貓咪們
All right, all right, now, run along, kittens.

我要和公主談談
I have to speak with the princess.

母親 你不會相信我看到了什麼
Mother, you won't believe what I saw.

你看到了一條龍
You saw a dragon.

阿蒂塔亞將軍通知我
General Atitāya informed me

你沒能拿到龍珠 空手而歸
that you'd be returning home without the gem pieces.

是希蘇
It was Sisu.

她可以解決我們的問題
She can fix what we broke.

她可以讓所有人都回來
She can bring everyone back.

這就是我害怕的地方
And that's what scares me.

等所有人都回來了
When everyone comes back,

你覺得他們會找誰算賬
who do you think they'll come for?

你忘了嗎
You forget.

其他部落把所有事都怪到我們頭上
The other lands blame us for what's happened.

但是我們…我們沒想讓任何人受傷
But we... We never meant for anyone to get hurt.

是的 但是如果我們有龍
Yes, but if we had the dragon

還有龍珠碎片
and the gem pieces,

我們就會被原諒
we would be forgiven.

我們可以拯救世界
We could save the world.

更重要的是 我們的人民能得到安全
But more importantly, our people would remain safe.

但拉雅不可能就這麼把希蘇給我們
But Raya isn't just gonna give Sisu to us.

我們不會給她選擇的機會
We're not going to give her a choice.

你要怎麼做
What are you going to do?

親愛的 這就不用你操心了
That's no longer your concern, my love.

你做的已經夠多了
You've done enough.

我們肚子裏的貨
If she refuses to help,

都已經進了馬桶了 如果她不幫忙
we've just flushed our tactical advantage

-可以砸她 -我知道
- into the dung pot. - I know.

她根本沒理由要幫我們
Yeah. She really has no reason to help us.

我知道
I know!

這個果干太難吃了
This jerky's terrible.

我知道
I know!

你確定這四個小恐怖分子
Are you sure those four miniature menaces

能成功嗎
will be successful?

我不知道
I don't know.

調料太多了
There's too much spice.

不對 竹子太多了
Uh, no. There's too much bamboo.

你懂什麼
What do you know?

你的味蕾跟一個大號嬰兒的差不多
You have the taste buds of a tall baby.

你穿得就像個大號嬰兒
Well, you dress like a tall baby.

把湯勺給我 我來負責
Give me the spoon! I'm taking over!

退後 海浪先生 我才是專業人員
Back off, tidal wave. I'm the professional here.

讓我試試
May I?

真好吃
That's good.

這是我爸教給我的
It's just a little something my ba showed me.

你那個美味的果干
Aw. Did he also show you

也是他教你做的嗎
how to make that delicious jerky?

不是 那是我自己發明的
No, that was all me.

要是能再跟他一起吃飯就好了
It'll be nice to share a meal with him again.

我明白你的意思
I know what you mean.

我有個特別討厭的姐姐
I have this really obnoxious sister

她總是弄亂我的頭髮
who always tousles my hair.

但我現在最想念的就是她
I can't wait to see her the most.

我們贏了之後
After we win the day,

我要看個夠
I look forward to filling my eyeball

我要盯著我的村莊滿是人民的美好畫面 眼睛都不眨
with the joytastic image of my village full again.

你也將跟你的家人團聚 諾諾
And you will be reunited with your family, Noi.

呃 你剛剛叫她什麼
Uh, what did you just call her?

諾諾 這是她的名字
Noi. It's her name.

就寫在她的衣領上
It's written on her collar.

你們都沒有檢查過嗎
Have none of you ever checked?

他們還說我是大老粗
And they think of me as the ruffian.

那什麼意思
What's that mean?

意思是 要開始了
It means we're on.

希蘇
Sisu,

在我們得到龍珠碎片
until we get that gem

並確認納瑪莉站在我們這邊之前
and confirm Namaari's actually on our side,

你要一直藏好 答應我
promise me you'll stay hidden.

看來你收到我的禮物了
I see you got my gift.

我從沒想過還能再見到它
I never thought I'd see this again.

好吧 呃…
Well, uh...

我盡量把它保存好
I tried to take good care of it.

你不是這裏唯一的龍呆子
You're not the only dragon nerd here.

最後一塊
The final piece.

是時候讓大家回來了
Time to bring everyone back.

希蘇和龍珠碎片跟我走
Sisu and the gem pieces are coming with me.

-希蘇 -別過來
- Sisu! - Stay back!

信任龍牙族的人真是太愚蠢了
It was foolish to trust someone from Fang!

不要再靠近了
Don't come any closer!

納瑪莉
Namaari,

不要這樣
it doesn't have to be like this.

我別無選擇
I don't have any other choice.

嘿 讓我處理
Hey. I got this.

我知道你不想傷害任何人
I know you don't wanna hurt anybody.

你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

你只是想要一個更好的世界
You just want a better world.

我們都想
Like we all do.

希蘇
Sisu...

我相信你 納瑪莉
I trust you, Namaari.

不
No!

希蘇
Sisu!

不
No...

怎麼回事
What's happening?

我不知道
I don't know.

好像最後一條龍消失之後
It appears that with the last dragon gone,

水也會消失
so too goes the water.

現在沒有什麼能阻止莊魔了
Now there is nothing to stop the Druun.

沒有了
Nothing.

拉雅
Raya?

拉雅呢
Where's Raya?

納瑪莉
Namaari!

讓我們做個瞭解吧 混蛋
Let's finish this, binturi.

拉雅
Raya!

她看不到我們
She cannot see us.

拉雅被自己的憤怒蒙蔽了雙眼
Raya's blinded by her own rage.

龍珠的力量正在減弱
The gem's powers are fading!

如果我們不幫這些人逃出去
All these people are Druun food

他們都會變成莊魔的食物
if we don't get them out.

來吧 相信我 沒事的
Come on! Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

愚蠢的莊魔 滾開
Stupid Druun! Out of my way!

快跑
Go, go, go!

上來吧
Up we go! Yep!

快走
Go, go! Hurry!

到水裏去 快跑
Get to the water! Keep going! Keep going!

快點
Come on! Come on!

我從來沒有想過會發生這些事
I never meant for any of this to happen.

騙子
Liar!

我不在乎你相不相信我
I don't care if you believe me.

希蘇相信我
Sisu did.

但是你不相信她
But you didn't trust her.

所以我們才會走到這個地步
That's why we're here.

你想做什麼就做什麼吧
Do whatever you want.

但是對於希蘇的死 你和我的責任一樣大
But you're as much to blame for Sisu's death as I am.

阿堂 那裏還有人
Tong, there's still people back there!

快點 我們沒時間了
Hurry! We're running out of time!

知道了
Got it!

所有人都出來 跟我來
Everyone, out! Come with me!

好了 圖圖 這是最後一批了
Okay, Tuk, these are the last of 'em.

快走 我們就跟在後面
Go! We're right behind you.

圖圖
Tuk Tuk!

還在等什麼 快走
What are you waiting for? Go!

拉雅
Raya!

就是你殺了希蘇
It's the one who slayed Sisu!

拉雅
Raya! Raya!

龍珠的魔力幾乎消失了
The gem's magic, it's almost gone!

沒法逼退它們了
They aren't backing off!

它們到處都是
They're everywhere!

我不知道他們為什麼選擇我
I don't know why they chose me.

選我們中的任何一個都可以
It could have been any of us.

我只知道 我信任他們
All I know is I trusted them,

他們信任我
and they trusted me.

所以…
And so...

所有人都把龍珠碎片給我
Everyone, give me your gems.

我們可以把它們合而為一 它就能起作用
We can still put it together. It can still work.

希蘇已經不在了 拉雅 我們沒有她的魔法
Sisu's gone, Raya! We don't have her magic!

這與她的魔法無關 這是關於信任的
It's not about her magic. It's about trust.

什麼
What?

這就是它能成功的原因 所以我們也能做到
That's why it worked. That's why we can do it, too.

只要能做到希蘇唯一希望的一件事
By doing the one thing Sisu wanted us to do.

做到我爸希望我們做到的事
What my ba wanted us to do.

只要我們最終能彼此信任 就能拯救世界
To finally trust each other and fix this.

但是我們團結起來
But we have to come together.

求你們了
Please.

但她做了那些事
After what she's done?

我們不能再信任她了
We'll never trust her!

那就讓我邁出第一步
Then let me take the first step.

拉雅 不要
Raya! No!

成功了
It worked! It worked!

圖圖
Tuk Tuk!

普拉妮 安巴
Pranee! Amba!

賈格
Jagan!

盤谷
Pengu!

耶
Yeah!

拉雅
Raya.

希蘇
Sisu.

我好餓啊
I am so hungry.

我有點果干
I got some jerky.

還沒那麼餓
Not that hungry.

希蘇
Sisu!

能再次聞到偉大之龍的臭氣 真是太好了
Aw, it's good to breathe in your glorious dragon stench again.

我就把這句話當成讚美好了
Okay, I take that as a compliment.

媽媽
Momma!

我的寶貝
My baby!

媽媽 看 是波弟
Mom, look, it's Boun!

是波弟
It's Boun!

爸
Ba?

露珠
Dewdrop?

爸
Ba!

真的是她嗎
Is that really her?

班加酋長 你女兒是你的驕傲
Chief Benja, your daughter did you proud.

希望你不要介意 她帶來了一些朋友
Hope you don't mind, she brought some friends.

爸
Ba?
